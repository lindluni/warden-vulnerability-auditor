# Vulnerability Auditor

GitHub Vulnerability Auditor is a command-line tool to audit your GitHub repositories for GitHub Security Advisories (
GHSA). It takes in a list of GitHub Security Advisories and a time threshold in months and returns a CSV and JSON file
containing all of your repositories affected by the list of GHSA's you provided, as well as the last time the repository
received a commit to its default branch and whether the last commit is older than the time threshold you provided.

Example Usage:

```shell
Usage: vulnerability-auditor [options]

Options:
  -V, --version             output the version number
  -t, --token <string>      GitHub personal access token
  -o, --org <string>        GitHub organization
  -h, --threshold <number>  Months since last commit
  -i, --ids <items>         Comma-separated list of GHSA IDs
  --help                    display help for command
```

`vulnerability-audit -t fake-token -o fake-org -h 12 -i GHSA-1234,GHSA-5678`

Will retrieve all repositories in the fake-org organization that contain the vulnerabilities GHSA-1234 and GHSA-5678 and
will flag those repos that have NOT been updated in the last 12 months.

*NOTE*: You may retrieve the GHSA IDs from the [GitHub Security Advisory page](https://github.com/advisories)
By selecting the vulnerability and copy-pasting the GHSA ID from the URL.
